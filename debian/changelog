skiboot (5.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * d/patches/fix-hardening-for-opal-gard.patch removed as it's applied upstream
  * d/control : 
    - added Depends on lsb-base for opal-prd.init
    - added ppc64 arch
  * d/rules :
    - proper clean is almost done by upstream, override_dh_auto_clean stripped
    - enabled tests where they make sense
  * d/patches/fix-distclean-for-gard-and-xscom-utils.patch : remaining cleanup
    to be forwarded upstream
  * d/opal-prd.socket : removed
    d/opal-prd.service : linked to upstream service file
    we now use service file from upstream that doesn't use systemd's socket
    : opal-prd already does all the socket handling.
  * d/patches/opal-prd-service-file-improvements.patch : added to handle man
    page and /etc/default/opal-prd properly (Closes: LP : #1549098)
  * Use upstream manpage :
    d/opal-prd.8 : fixes were applied upstream
    d/opal-prd.manpages : use upstream manpage 
  * d/patches/direct-systemd-to-always-restart-opal-prd.patch : applying
    upstream patch in advance to restart opal-prd irrespective of why it
    stopped.  (Closes: LP : #1671019)

skiboot (5.2.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Forced no-pie for Ubuntu 16.10 as previous change was not enough : in 16.10
    gcc's default change to build PIE by default.
